## System Architecture

The system is built as a monorepo using pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, and TypeScript 5.9. The frontend is developed with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. The API backend is powered by Express 5, using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database management. Authentication is handled by Clerk, with `@clerk/react` for the frontend and `@clerk/express` for the backend, proxied at `/api/__clerk`. Zod is used for validation, and Orval generates API codegen from an OpenAPI spec. The build process uses esbuild for CJS bundles.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Amy AI Brand:** Features a cute SVG character (AmyIcon), a floating assistant button (AmyFab), and Amy avatars/copy throughout.
- **Mobile-friendly:** Responsive layouts with bottom navigation on mobile and full sidebar on desktop.

**Technical Implementations:**

- **Parenting Hub:** A 7-section collapsible layout including AI prompts, research articles, daily tips, emotional support, activities, Smart Olympiad Zone (MCQs, practice, progress, adaptive difficulty), and Life Skills Mode (daily tasks across categories, tri-lingual support).
- **Routine Generator:** A fully rule-based, zero-cost engine (`routine-templates.ts`) providing age-appropriate templates, handling school/no-school, mood, parent availability, and food type.
- **Smart Nutrition & Regional Meal Localization:** Offers 5 veg + 5 non-veg options per meal type with seeded rotation and regional cuisine tailoring (North Indian, South Indian, Bengali, Gujarati, Maharashtrian, Punjabi, Global, Pan-Indian default).
- **Recipe Viewer:** Static recipe database with keyword matching.

- **Next-Day Auto-Generation:** Triggers a dialog to auto-generate tomorrow's routine upon task completion, with weekend detection.

- **Share Routine:** Functionality to copy routines as formatted messages or share via WhatsApp.

- **Infant Mode:** Replaces routine form with care guidance, lullaby player, and parent tasks checklist for infants.
- **Skill Focus & Story Sections:** Age-appropriate skill activities and moral stories with TTS.

- **AmyNest Mobile App:** Expo React Native app mirroring the web product for iOS and Android, including full authentication, onboarding, dashboards, child management, routines, coaching, and profile management.
- **Smart Usage-Based Paywall:** Tracks per-user, per-section feature usage and surfaces a paywall after the first sample. Implemented with `useSectionUsage` + `LockedBlock` on web (Parenting Hub: Activities/Olympiad/Life Skills) and mobile (Activities/Life Skills); paywall reason `section_locked` shared across platforms.
- **Referral System:** Each user gets a unique referral code (auto-generated on first dashboard visit). Friends sign up with `?ref=CODE` (captured in localStorage on web, AsyncStorage + deep-link on mobile, submitted post-signin). Referrals progress `pending → valid → paid` (valid on first child creation, paid on subscription activation). Reward = 30 days bonus premium per milestone (3 valid + 1 paid), capped at 3 rewards / 90 days lifetime. Bonus time tracked separately on `subscriptions.bonusExpiresAt` so paid renewals never shrink it; `isPremiumNow` honors both. Routes: `GET /api/referrals/me`, `POST /api/referrals/attribute`. UI: web `/referrals` + nav link + "or invite friends" CTA in paywall modal; mobile `/referrals` route + profile-screen CTA.
