    objective: "Help your child move from emotional flooding to a regulated state — without lectures or punishment.",
    explanation:
      "When a child is upset, the thinking part of their brain (prefrontal cortex) goes offline and the emotional brain (limbic system) takes over. No amount of reasoning works in this state — they literally can't access logic. Your job in that moment is not to teach, but to co-regulate. By staying calm, lowering your voice, and offering presence instead of solutions, you signal safety. Once their nervous system feels safe, the thinking brain comes back online — and only then can a real conversation happen. Over weeks, your child internalises this pattern and starts self-regulating.",
    actions: [
      "Get down to your child's eye level and soften your face.",
      "Lower your voice to half-volume — slower than feels natural.",

      "Offer a body anchor — a hug, hand on back, or sit beside them.",
      "Wait until breathing slows before talking about what happened.",
    ],
    example:
      "Your 6-year-old slams her homework book and shouts \"I HATE THIS!\" Instead of \"Don't shout at me\", you sit beside her, breathe slowly, and say \"That looked really frustrating\". Two minutes of silence later, she leans into you. Now — and only now — you can ask what made it hard.",
    mistake:
      "Reasoning, threatening, or punishing while the child is dysregulated. \"If you don't calm down right now…\" pours fuel on the fire and teaches them their big feelings are dangerous to you.",

When you connect first (a warm look, a touch, naming the feeling), the child's nervous system relaxes and the thinking brain stays online. The correction that follows is then heard, not resisted. This isn't permissive parenting — limits still hold firm. It's the *order* that changes everything: feel-then-fix, not fix-then-feel.",

The same applies to \"don't shout\", \"don't spill\", \"don't hit\". Each negative command forces the child to first picture the wrong thing, then suppress it, then guess the right thing. That's three steps. A positive instruction is one step — and it works in seconds. This isn't a small tweak — it's one of the highest-leverage shifts in everyday parenting.",
